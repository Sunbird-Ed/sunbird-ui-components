        <p>Amazon Textract is a service that automatically extracts text and data from scanned documents. Amazon Textract goes beyond simple optical character recognition (OCR) to also identify the contents of fields in forms and information stored in tables.</p>
        <p>Many companies today extract data from documents and forms through manual data entry thatâ€™s slow and expensive or through simple optical character recognition (OCR) software that requires manual customization or configuration. Rules and workflows for each document and form often need to be hard-coded and updated with each change to the form or when dealing with multiple forms. If the form deviates from the rules, the output is often scrambled and unusable.</p>
